        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Clean the pork. Add all pork to a large pot, add 1 tbsp salt, add tap water until just covering the meat, and bring to a boil on high heat. Once it hits a boil, leave it alone for a minute, remove from heat, drain the water and rinse the pork under running water.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Return the pork to the pot with all remaining soup ingredients and filtered water this time, but set the shrimp aside. Bring to high heat, and maintain a boil for 5 minutes, then skim the soup scum that rises to the top.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Lower the heat to maintain a low boil for an additional 15 to 25 minutes, based on how tender you’d like the pork to get.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Devein and peel the shrimp, sprinkle salt and sugar over them, mix, and marinate for 10 minutes. Boil water on medium high heat in a small pot and cook the shrimp in 1 or 2 batches. They’re done as soon as they turn white/pink.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Cook bánh canh noodles according to package instructions, then drain.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Into 5-6 bowls, evenly divide in this order: noodles, broth, pork, shrimp, accoutrements, then serve.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add pork to a large soup pot. Cover with water until it just covers the pork.<br> Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Take out the pork and then throw away the water. This process cleans the pork. Rinse the pot and add the pork back. Cover the pork with fresh water until it just covers the meat. Bring to a boil.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the onion and simmer for 1.5 hours. <br>Make sure to check every 30 minutes for impurities. Scoop away any you see.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> While the soup is simmering, combine 1 cup of water and tamarind in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and let it simmer until the tamarind dissolves.You can help speed up the process by using the back of a spoon to crush the tamarind. Pour the tamarind through a fine mesh sieve into a small bowl. Set aside.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After simmering the soup for 1.5 hours, add the pineapple and ginger to the soup. Simmer for another 20 minutes.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Put the catfish in and simmer for another 10 minutes until it is cooked through.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Lastly, add the vegetables and tamarind from step 3. Bring the soup to a boil and serve with a side of white rice. Make sure to taste the soup for seasoning and add more salt if it tastes bland.
